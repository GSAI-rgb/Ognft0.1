The AI engineer successfully progressed from cloning a basic homepage to building a full-fledged e-commerce application. Initially, a pixel-perfect clone of the AXM homepage was created using mock data, followed by expanding it into a multi-page e-commerce site with product, shop, cart, and profile pages, including functional routing. A major pivot occurred with the Make It OG master prompt, shifting focus to performance optimization, a token-based theme system, and comprehensive Shopify Storefront API integration, while preserving the AXM layout. Key improvements included fixing navigation flashing, implementing a robust search feature, and setting up internationalization. The current work involves re-skinning the homepage with the specific OG theme content, copying, and features as detailed in the master prompt, building out new components for the OG aesthetic. The trajectory shows a systematic, iterative approach to meeting complex requirements and refining the application's architecture and user experience.

The user initially requested a pixel-perfect clone of , replicating all styles, layouts, designs, interactive elements, and responsive behavior. This evolved into a request for a complete e-commerce website, including product pages, cart, profile, about, journal, and contact pages, all with accurate styling and functional links. Subsequently, a comprehensive Make It OG mandate was issued, demanding a re-skin of the AXM layout with a specific OG film theme (colors, typography, motion via tokens), performance budgets (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.05, TTI < 3.0s), full Shopify Storefront GraphQL integration (products, collections, cart, metafields), India-first UX (UPI/COD, EN/TE toggle, Lite Mode), and fan-first features (rank-based drops, countdowns, scene codes, Fan Army Wall). The navigation flashing issue was reported and fixed, followed by a request for a search feature with autocomplete. The most recent explicit request is to transform the existing homepage into the OG film official merch homepage, preserving AXM's section structure and spacing, but applying the OG theme, specific content, copy, and fan-first elements for hero, Rebel Drops, Fan Arsenal, Choose Your Arsenal, Fan Army Wall, and From the Firestorm sections, and updating the footer.
