The AI engineer successfully transitioned the application from an AXM homepage clone to a full e-commerce platform, integrating a Make It OG cinematic theme with specific content, performance targets, and Shopify Storefront API capabilities. Key achievements include a comprehensive homepage re-skin, fixing a critical mobile product detail page layout issue, and resolving an infinite loop bug in the search functionality using . The project then pivoted to full Shopify integration, including automated product and collection creation using Admin API scripts, handling complex product image structures. The current challenge revolves around correctly generating premium product names, ensuring all images (front/back, color variants) are uploaded, and making newly created products consistently visible across both the local frontend and the Shopify storefront, addressing a recent domain change and the need for a robust product creation logic.

The user initially requested a pixel-perfect clone of an AXM website, expanding into a multi-page e-commerce site with standard pages (product, cart, profile, etc.). This evolved into a Make It OG mandate: re-skinning the AXM layout with a specific OG film theme (colors, typography, motion via tokens), achieving performance budgets (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.05, TTI < 3.0s), and implementing full Shopify Storefront GraphQL integration (products, collections, cart, metafields). India-first UX (UPI/COD, EN/TE toggle, Lite Mode) and fan-first features (rank-based drops, countdowns, Fan Army Wall) were specified. Specific page transformations included the homepage (Hero, Rebel Drops, Fan Arsenal, Choose Your Arsenal, Fan Army Wall, From the Firestorm), Collections page (OG ranks), All Products page (Armory), and Product Detail Page (OG titles, Telugu accents, Add to Arsenal CTA). A bug in product detail page mobile layout was reported, and a struggling and glitching search feature needed fixing. Finally, the user requested full Shopify configuration and automated product upload with premium names and proper image handling.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing critical issues related to Shopify product creation and visibility. Previously, an automated script () successfully created 78 products on a newly configured Shopify store () using Admin API credentials. However, the user reported that the auto-generated product names (e.g., Ocean Waves, Product 1) were trash and not premium. More importantly, the image upload process did not correctly handle complex folder structures for variants (e.g.,  for colors) or multiple views (e.g.,  images), leading to incomplete or incorrect image displays. Products were also not consistently visible on the Storefront API, although the backend confirmed their creation via the Admin API.

The AI engineer has re-analyzed the user's  directory structure, confirming the presence of both front/back and color variant image organizations. Acknowledging previous errors, the current work involves stopping the old, incorrect product creation, and initiating the development of a  script. This new script aims to correctly interpret the folder structure, generate *premium, real product names*, and accurately upload all relevant images to create proper product variants, ensuring they are fully visible and correctly displayed in both the local application and the Shopify storefront. The engineer has confirmed products currently exist in the Shopify store but still needs to rectify their names and image associations.
